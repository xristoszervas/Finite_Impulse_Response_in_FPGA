# Finite_Impulse_Response_in_FPGA
FIR Filter Design &amp; FPGA Implementation  This project uses Python to design, simulate, and generate coefficients for a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, which is then implemented on an FPGA for real-time digital signal processing. It provides an end-to-end demonstration from algorithm development to hardware deployment

In more detail: 

Overview

1) Python-Based FIR Filter Design:

Filter Specification: Define key parameters such as filter order, cutoff frequency, passband/stopband ripple, and transition width.

Coefficient Calculation: Use Python libraries (like NumPy and SciPy) to compute the filter coefficients with design methods such as the windowing technique.

Simulation & Analysis: Validate the filter’s frequency response and time-domain performance using tools such as Matplotlib for visualization.

2) HDL Implementation:

Verilog/VHDL Design: Translate the FIR filter algorithm into a hardware description language. The design leverages a multiply-accumulate (MAC) architecture that sequentially processes the input data using the precomputed coefficients.

Modular Structure: Create separate modules for coefficient storage, data buffering, and the MAC unit, ensuring a scalable and efficient implementation.

3) Testbench and Simulation:

Behavioral Verification: Develop a testbench to simulate the FIR filter module, comparing its output against the Python simulation results.

Timing and Edge Cases: Ensure the design handles real-time data streams correctly, with proper clocking and control signals.

4) FPGA Synthesis & Deployment:

Toolchain Integration: Use FPGA vendor tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado) to synthesize the design, apply timing constraints, and generate the bitstream.

Hardware Verification: Deploy the design on an FPGA development board and test the filter in a real-time signal processing environment.
