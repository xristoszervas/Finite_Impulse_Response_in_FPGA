# Finite_Impulse_Response_in_FPGA
FIR Filter Design &amp; FPGA Implementation  This project uses Python to design, simulate, and generate coefficients for a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, which is then implemented on an FPGA for real-time digital signal processing. It provides an end-to-end demonstration from algorithm development to hardware deployment
